## Important to know

The application will work in "read-only" for any users having access to the site. However, to be able to save and edit Site Designs and Site Scripts, the users *must" have the SharePoint global administrator privileges !

## API Permissions

In order to allow the lookup of users and groups in the current tenant, The permission `Directory.AccessAsUser.All` to Microsoft Graph API is requested.
CAUTION: 
The solution is installed globally on the tenant, it means this permission, when granted, will be granted to the whole tenant.
However, it will allow the application to only see the groups and users the current user is allowed to see. Thus, it should not cause any security breach.
It will only be needed for the ability to grant Site Designs to specific principals. The other features will be working seamlessly without this granted permission
